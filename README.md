YARY: Yet Another Robot for You

This is a self-balancing robot built with an Arduino Pro Mini. 
This is an adaptation of the implementation of the 
"Your Arduino Balancing Robot (YABR)" project by Joop Brokking,
who really deserves all the credit for this project! 
Joop is an extraordinary engineer.

The "adaptation" consists of: 
1) Replacement of the Wii NunChuck controller with an Android app -- see folder Android/ 
2) 3D printed body - see folder 3DPrint/ 
3) Wiring of most components on protoboards to allow easy reuse of these components later on
