This is an adaptation of the implementation of the 
"Your Arduino Balancing Robot (YABR)" project by Joop Brokking,
who really deserves all the credit for this! Joop is an
extraordinary engineer.

The "adaptation" consists of: 
1) the replacement of the Wii NunChuck controller with an Android app (implements basically a Bluetooth Joystick), 
2) the 3D printed body, and 
3) wiring on protoboards to allow easy re-use of most of the components.
